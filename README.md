# Rick-and-Morty-API
This is a client application which consumes the Rick and Morty API. Rick and Morty APP  that retrieves a list of locations (name and type), along with the residents of that location and their status.

It uses React Server Components and TanStack Query for all the data fetching.

The project was  written in JavaScript at first. But it was migrated to TypeScript eventually.

I've used GraphQL Code Generator to create type definitions automatically.

A feature-based folder structure has been implemented to keep things organized.

A live demo is here.

The Rick and Morty API
This is a really cool public API which provides you the characters, locations and episodes. It has both Rest and GraphQL implementations. So, you can use it to learn and explore new techniques, libraries etc.
